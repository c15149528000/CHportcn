# Donations 
#####(Thanks Xelamats)
I've been getting asked a lot about if I will ever put a donation link up and I've decide to do so. Please, don't think this means I will make this pay to use or "I have to get a certain amount or I'll stop working on it." I will not do that and I do not plan on ever doing that right now. I love what I do and I love that it makes others happy; so, as long as I continue to see that.. I will continue this project.

The donation link for those who wish to donate something to me: https://goo.gl/chlE8k

REMEMBER; I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO DONATE TO ME, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO.
