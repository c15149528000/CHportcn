# Things are going to be more strict, re-read this.

# How to report Bugs/Suggestions/Requests/Comments
### Before making an issue, check the to-do list before. https://github.com/berbb/PortAIO/blob/master/TO-DO.txt
1. Make a GitHub accounts if you don't already.
2. Sign in and go to : https://github.com/berbb/PortAIO/issues
3. Make a new issue and state the title and what you need/want to report.

- How I will prioritize things now, bug reports > suggestions > requests > comments/concerns.

### Bug Report Format :
Champion Name (eg. Ahri) / Utility (eg. Evade) : 

If this is an issue about a champion, is this Champion dual-port supported (Check via PortAIO Misc)? If yes which one? :

Issue/Problems (Try to be as detailed as possible) : 

#
- When making an issue be SPECIFIC, don't give me a one fucking line report saying it doesn't work. What doesn't work and maybe why you don't think it works. If an addon crashes, when does it crash, who does it crash with? If you have an issue with a dual-port supported champion, which dual-port are you using? etc... Don't give me fucking bullshit and expect me to read your damn mind and exactly know your situation to fix it.

#### DO. NOT. PM. ME. ABOUT. PORTAIO. ALL COMMENTS GO ON ISSUES.
#### Don't buy ported addon's, ask me via an issue and I'll mostly likely do it for free.

## Why was PortAIO gone for a few days?
- I was planning to comeback June 10th but school got unpredictably manageable lately and plus I got tired of Rexy tryna continue my port so I had to comeback lmfao.
- I was ready to move to GOS (GamingOnSteroids), but I didn't and I'm still thinking about it.
- I was planning this departure since the beginning of May, cause I needed to catch up on school AND the AIO.
- @the people on the Discord that like to spread bullshit and put words in my mouth == It had NOTHING to do with Rexy or anyone I just fucking despise him.
