To-Do :
- Check Lee Sin Manual R to Combo Key Q
- Vayne R in VHR doesnt automatically use in combo with x enemies around.
- Darius Q makes him stand still in combo, also doesnt use W.
- Nidalee Q prediction is waaaaaaay off (idk if there'll ever be a fix for that cos i havent seen a decent Q in any nid script)
- Olaf doesnt cast W in combo and also throws Q at an enemys feet instead of behind them.
- Aatrox doesnt work at all
- ELTrundle casts E in front of the enemy, rather than behind them to stop them escaping.
- Viktor E is EXTREMELY buggy in waveclear, it will stutterstep about 5x per sec until it reaches X amount of minions it can cast it on.
- ELSinged doesnt Cast E in combo.
- Pantheon cancels E in combo mode after using it for 0.5 seconds.
- Maokai is just hella buggy in general, barely uses Q or W in combo, R cancels itself after enemy leaves the ult radius, doesnt auto attack in combo or wave clear modes.

- Bard Flee [Don't have Bard so can't fix]
- Tahm Kench Crash [Don't have TK]
